# Tuten_Test
My attempt at completing your test utilized AngularJS 1.6.9

I am unable to complete this test, for I do not know how to make http connections through AngularJS.

I copied the body response for Part 2 into the dashboard.html to show I could perform those tasks, however I have become stuck when needing to access the nested objects/arrays that are in ng-repeat.

You can open the dashboard.html file in a webbrowser (such as Google Chrome) to see that the filter part of the code works
